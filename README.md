# Milestone-psuedo-AI
A script to play Milestone on IRC on my behalf in a very efficient manner. 

One of the other IRC networks I'm on (which will be shutting down soon *cry*) had a Milestone (Mille Bornes) bot.

I wrote this several years ago as a way of automating the game for me without me actually having to play it myself.

It works, but it's also incomplete and will remain incomplete due to the fact that the bot no longer exists.

It's sort of a precursor for my psuedo-AI scripts. However, unlike the UNO script I wrote last year (or the year before), this one isn't as asthetically beautiful.

I'm only uploading it because it would be a shame to lose it.
